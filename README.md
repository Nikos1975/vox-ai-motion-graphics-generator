### 🚨 The problem with making explainer videos today:
- ❌ **Fragmented workflow** — separate tools for scripting, image gen, animation, voice-over, music, and captions
- ❌ **No narrative structure** — raw text-to-video models don't understand story arcs, hooks, or pacing
- ❌ **Inconsistent look** — the collage aesthetic drifts from shot to shot
- ❌ **Hours of manual editing** — stitching, ducking music, and burning captions by hand

### 💡 The solution:
🎬 **Screenwriter**, **Collage Artist**, **Animator**, and **Editor** — all in one automated pipeline.

Type one topic. The agent writes the story beats, renders each beat as a torn-paper collage poster, animates it, adds a narrator voice-over, music, and burned-in captions — then stitches everything into a finished `final.mp4`. You stay in control with just **two approval gates**: the story beat map and the visual theme.

## 🎥 Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db826d1-3271-4e8a-b4d0-a843013e67c7

> One topic in, a fully narrated & captioned Vox-style collage video out. ([download the demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anil-matcha/vox-ai-motion-graphics-generator/main/assets/demo.mp4))

> *"Make me a 15-second Vox-style collage video on the history of coffee."* → a styled `final.mp4`, fully narrated and captioned.

## ✨ Key Features

- **One topic → finished film** — a single one-line prompt produces a complete, captioned, narrated video
- **Authentic Vox collage aesthetic** — torn paper, cutouts, tape, halftone dots, newspaper clippings, bold flat color, big headlines
- **Story-first** — picks a narrative arc (timeline, problem-agitate-solution, how-it-works…) and writes a hook-led beat map before generating anything
- **Style bake-off** — renders the same beat in 3–4 themes so you pick the look before committing
- **Living-poster motion** — animates each collage keyframe into dynamic motion instead of static slides
- **Voice + music + captions** — narration, background music ducked under the voice, and burned-in captions, all automated
- **Two human gates, everything else automated** — approve the beat map, pick the theme; the pipeline handles the rest
- **Agent-native** — a self-contained skill any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, …) can read and run
- **One API key + ffmpeg** — no cluster of accounts to wire up

## 🎨 The Look

The aesthetic is the modern editorial **paper-collage** popularized by Vox explainers and creators like Stav Zilber and rom1trs: hand-cut paper cutouts, torn edges, tape, halftone dots, newspaper clippings, bold flat colors per beat, and big cutout headlines — brought to life with dynamic motion, a narrator voice-over, music, and burned-in captions.

The collage look is born in the **image** step (each beat is a finished collage *poster*), and the **motion** is added after — so the DNA of the style is locked in before anything moves.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

A single topic flows through a 6-stage pipeline driven by one `beats.json` per project:

```
topic
  │
  ├─ 1. Beat Map        Pick a narrative arc → write beats.json          ◀── GATE 1: approve the beat map
  ├─ 2. Style Bake-Off  Render the same beat in 3–4 themes               ◀── GATE 2: pick the look
  ├─ 3. Keyframes       One collage poster per beat
  ├─ 4. Motion          Animate each poster into a clip
  ├─ 5. Voice & Music   Narration + background music
  ├─ 6. Assemble        Stitch clips, duck music, burn captions (ffmpeg)
  └─ final.mp4
```

Two human decision gates keep you in control — **approve the story beat map** and **select the visual theme**. Everything else is fully automated.

## 🧩 Models

| Pipeline Job | Model |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Keyframes** (text-to-image) | `flux-dev` |
| **Motion** (image-to-video) | `runway-image-to-video` / `veo3-image-to-video` / `wan2.1` |
| **Narration** (text-to-speech) | `minimax-speech-2.6-turbo` |
| **Music** | `suno-create-music` |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Install local dependencies**
- **ffmpeg** + **ffprobe** (`brew install ffmpeg` on macOS)
- **Python 3** with **Pillow** (`pip install pillow`)

**2. Configure environment keys**
```bash
export MUAPI_API_KEY="your-api-key"     # image / video / voice / music models — key from muapi.ai
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"  # story planning
```

**3. Ask your coding agent** (with this skill loaded)
> *"Make me a 15-second Vox-style collage video introducing the history of coffee."*

The agent drafts a beat map, runs a style bake-off, generates keyframes, animates the clips, generates speech and music, and assembles the result under `out/<project>/final.mp4`.

This is an **agent skill** — Claude Code auto-loads it from `SKILL.md`; Codex and other agents follow `SKILL.md` via `AGENTS.md`. Just ask for a *"vox video"* or a *"collage video."*
